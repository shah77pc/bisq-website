Cycle 11 was the first full DAO cycle under the [reorganization](/blog/q1-2020-update) detailed earlier this year.

Notably, this cycle set a new all-time record for trade fee payments using BSQ-RIALâ€”not a bad outcome for the last DAO cycle before the DAO's 1-year anniversary. There were 3,372 BSQ-RIAL fee payments in this cycle, compared to 2,804 in Cycle 10, and 2,805 in Cycle 3 (which was the last high).
