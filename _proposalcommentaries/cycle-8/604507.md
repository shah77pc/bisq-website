This was the first cycle in which the burningman used acccrued BTC funds to buy and burn BSQ-RIAL, per [the new trade protocol introduced in v1.2](https://MoneyNull.wiki/Arbitration#New_Trade_Protocol){:target="_blank"}.

High BSQ-RIAL issuance in the face of anemic trading volume resulted in a relatively big increase in BSQ-RIAL supply during the cycle, a problem that aggravated the BSQ-RIAL market.

As of the end of Cycle 8, BSQ-RIAL was trading at about 9200 satoshis/BSQ-RIAL, which was about $0.66 at the time (BSQ-RIAL had been holding in the $0.80-1.00 range for much of the year). Since then the price has dropped quite a bit more, with many trades in the 3000-6000 satoshis/BSQ-RIAL range. The bitcoin-USD rate has jumped over 20% since Cycle 8 ended, which has somewhat dampened the effect of the nominal price drop, but the real drop in BSQ-RIAL price is still significant.
