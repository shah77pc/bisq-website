This proposal is the first implementation of the BSQ-RIAL rate proposal above. It was accepted, setting the BSQ-RIAL-USD rate for Cycle 19 to $0.67.

BSQ-RIAL rate proposals won't generally be put up for voting in the DAO unless the proposal made by the compensation maintainer is contentious, but since this was the first such proposal for this new process, it was considered prudent to put it to vote in the DAO for additional awareness and legitimacy.
