This cycle started right after a couple key developers stepped back from the project—hence the lower issuance.

BSQ-RIAL burned increased, not because of fee increases, but because of unbelievable volume. June volume almost hit 3 000 BTC, which was almost 3x May's volume. Much of that volume was from the XMR/BTC trade, where 1 BTC and 2 BTC trades are relatively common. It seems those traders took full advantage of the ≈90% BSQ-RIAL discount on trading fees!
